### Some Bold Assumptions:
1. Search Engines want to deliver the most relevant content to the user. Their usage success depends on it, and it’s why Google is the current king.
2. Relevancy used to be hard to quantify, so search engines went after keywords.
3. Technology advanced, and now advanced segmentation capabilities are industry standard.

### So how does this help marketers?
Think about it this way; what is the best way to let your friend know that you found something they would find interesting? You tell them. Today? You post it on social media.

It’s the low-hanging fruit for Search Engines. Establish relevancy and reputation by indexing social media shares for a page, and the better listings will (presumably) be shared more.

So, junior digital marketers of Q1 2014 (because let’s be honest, this stuff changes very rapidly), focus on building up great content that people want to share, and I bet you will see more SEO juice coming off those articles.
