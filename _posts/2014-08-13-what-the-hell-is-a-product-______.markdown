## What is a product?
A product is something a company sells. Okay, everyone knows that. In the tech world, a product is the app/software/service that a company sells. *(P.S. Ecommerce friends — if you’re not selling something that you made yourself, your product tends to be your website!)*

## Great, what’s a product manager?
A product manager (PM) is the person who is usually in charge of the conception, development and growth of a product. The PM ensures that the development of the product aligns to business goals.

I like to think that the tech PM’s job is to guide design and development teams to build something that people want to pay for.

## So then, what’s a product owner?
As the name suggests, this is the person who owns the product over all. In a smaller company that produces single to few products, the owner and PM can be the same person (as well as being CEO). In larger companies, these duties get delegated to maintain sanity and efficiency.

## And, what’s a product strategist?
A product strategist does the research and analysis to help PMs decide what to build. Often the PM fills this role, but as development scales dedicated strategists can be valuable.

I’ve seen a few product shops hiring dedicated strategist roles/teams. This seems to signal a greater emphasis on dediated research and analysis on development projects. And I’m betting it’s a way to educate the eventual product owner (the client) on how best to evolve the product.

## Ok I get it, but what’s a product designer?
A product design designs the product, which usually means that they design the UI and interaction.

Okay… the term product designer is a bit of elitist designer BS. It’s the term we adopted to say that we want to design apps and sites, not marketing materials.

As an experienced veteran of the mask/make-logo-pop/export-jpeg world of marketing design, I get it. But seriously, our engineering brethren aren’t walking around calling themselves product developers.

## And why do we care?
Well, shared vocabulary helps people build a shared context. But in the case of designers, maybe we should care less and pick fewer ‘cool’ names for what we do.

*Apologies to my friends currently rocking the product designer moniker. I do get that there is currently a salary aspect to the conversation that I didn’t touch, but I don’t think that it’s a serious long-term issue.*
