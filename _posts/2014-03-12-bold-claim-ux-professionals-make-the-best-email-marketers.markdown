One of the best bits of UX work I’ve done was a map of the entire userflow of the Ecommerce site at my old company. It had many branches, covered every contingency, and anyone who I walked through it with came away with a far better understanding of how our site worked.

That map was my go-to diagram when we made UX decisions, and helped me immensely in terms of selling ideas to Sr. Management. However, the biggest thing it did was help me build out a very comprehensive triggered email strategy. Every contingency was covered and I got to back up UX assumptions with emails that solicited feedback from users.

## Okay WTF are you talking about?
Right now, the email marketing world is the sole domain of marketers, but I never understood that. The big email marketing companies are relying on techniques that designers were using years ago — a/b tests, soliciting feedback and personalization.

Understanding the user is the big trend in email marketing, except.. that’s our entire field. To understand the user, and eliminate friction points through design.

This reminds me of the emergence of PPC and how suddenly, SEO was less important. Except in 2014, every PPC strategy is built off proper code-side SEO… Marketers can’t just throw money at processes that designers and developers needed to spend time on.

## So what now?
Alongside IA, IxD, UI design etc, we need to make email part of our skillsets. It’s a VERY helpful way to solicit feedback, and to mitigate negativity in some bolder UX experimentation.

Most of all, we’re the ones building out the flows, and we’re the ones who understand the user best. Under that premise, we should also be the ones who can find the best opportunities to send an email to the user.

## But I hate emails!
Great. And I bet you hate IE, and dropdown megamenus, and a million other things that people have become accustom to. Get past it.

## Email + UX = ❤
