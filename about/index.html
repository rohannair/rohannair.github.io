      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a frontend architect, UX designer, digital strategist, and sometimes writer from Toronto, Ontario (okay, I'm actually from Waterloo, but am living in Toronto).</p>
      <p>I'm also really bad at talking about myself...</p>
      <p>I've worked for Well.ca, an award-winning Canadian startup as a designer/frontend developer/digital marketer/product manager/swiss-army-knife. I've also worked with many startups, small-businesses and not-for-profits to help them build an online presence and digital strategy.</p>       
      <p>I'm currently working with high-growth companies to help craft their digital strategy, including User Experience, acquisition and product strategies.</p>
